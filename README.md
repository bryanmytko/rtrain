_Oooooooooooooo!_

How to use RTrain
**Install**
```
gem install rtrain
```
**Put this in your Gemfile**
```
gem 'rtrain', '~> 0.1.1'
```

**After generating a scaffold, in your Rails application open up irb in the command line and enter**
```
require 'rtrain'
```
and
```
RTrain.run
```
**That's it! Now your Rails application is equipped with an RTrain!**
